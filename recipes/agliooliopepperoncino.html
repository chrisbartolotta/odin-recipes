        <h3>Aglio Olio Pepperoncino</h3>
        <p>This late-night Roman staple is astonishingly full-flavored. Start the water before you do anything else, because the sauce takes less than 10 minutes start to finish.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>2 to 3 freish peperoncini</li>
            <li>2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
            <li>3/4 lb spaghetti</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a pot of salted water on to boil. Remove the stems of the peperoncini, halve them lengthwise, then slice them into 1/4-inch lengths. Put the oil, garlic and peperoncini in a large deep pan set over medium-high heat, and cook until the garlic is translucent and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the parsley to the pan, and turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta until it is aldente, nearly but not quite done and still a bit chalky in the middle. Drain, and reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>When the oil has cooled for a couple of minutes, add 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, and reduce over high heat by about half. Add the pasta, and stir vigorously as it continues to cook. Add the reserved pasta water a bit at a time as necessary to finish cooking the pasta, and develop the thickened sauce. Season with salt, and serve.</li>
